### A stress-free approach for landlords and residents

Getting EV infrastructure into communal car parks can be challenging and costly for landlords, so if you live in an apartment building, it’s likely that you have limited or no access to EV charge points.

And this could mean that EV ownership isn’t an option for you, or that you’re paying much higher public charging rates to charge your vehicle.

But we believe that everyone should have access to **reliable**, **low-cost EV charging at home**, and by letting your landlord know about our fully funded solutions, you could help to make this a reality for you and your neighbours.

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/105899/1726476762-ik_easee_0426-1-copy.jpeg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&h=2000&w=2000)

### How it works

We remove many of the financial and operational barriers to large-scale EV infrastructure investment for residential landlords by offering **fully funded**, **maintained** and **managed EV charging solutions**.

Our funded solutions are financed by the Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund (CIIF), which is sponsored by the UK Government.

We'll manage the entire process on behalf of your landlord, from the initial scheme design right through to the commissioning of the charge points - making it a completely hands-off approach for them.

And via a subscription service, we’ll provide you with a home charging experience, which gives you **energy at cost**, **maintenance support** and **ongoing customer service**.

### What to do next

01

## Contact your landlord

If you'd like to see EV charging installed at your building, then simply tell your landlord about our funded EV charging solutions for apartment buildings and encourage them to get in touch with us.

02

## Request our resources

If you'd like us to send you an example email or provide you with more detailed information to send to your landlord, please send your request to enquiries@energy-park.co.uk.

03

## We'll take care of the rest

If your landlord gets in touch, we’ll take it from there. And you’ll hopefully see us installing EV charge points in your communal car park very soon!

##### Can you help with the ongoing management and maintenance of the EV charge points?

+


 -


Yes, via our cloud-based software platform we can provide ongoing maintenance, as well as service support for you and customer support for drivers. We’ll carry out in-person periodic testing, and if issues arise that can’t be rectified remotely, we’ll send a technician to your site.

- Our privacy policy
- Definitions

### Our privacy policy

Energy Park respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you as to how we look after your personal data when you visit our website (regardless of where you visit it from) and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

Please also use the Definitions to understand the meaning of some of the terms used in this privacy policy.

**Important information and who we are**

**Purpose of this privacy policy**

This privacy policy aims to give you information on how Energy Park collects and processes your personal data through your use of this website, including any data you may provide through this website when you sign up to our service relating to the use of public charge points for your electric vehicle.

This website is not intended for those under 16 and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

It is important that you read this privacy policy together with any other privacy policy or fair processing policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy policy supplements other notices and privacy policies and is not intended to override them.

**Change of purpose**

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

**Disclosures of your personal data**

We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.

▪  External Third Parties as set out in the Definitions.

▪  Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

**International transfers**

We do not transfer your personal data outside the UK.

**Data security**

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

**Data retention**

**How long will you use my personal data for?**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

**Your legal rights**

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below under Your Legal Rights to find out more about these rights.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.

**No fee usually required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

To find out how we use Cookies on our website, please see our [Terms & Conditions](https://energy-park.co.uk/privacy-policy/terms-and-conditions).

### Definitions

**LAWFUL BASIS**

**Legitimate Interest** means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

**Performance of Contract** means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

**Comply with a legal obligation** means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.

**THIRD PARTIES**

**External Third Parties**

▪  Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.

▪ Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.

▪ HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.

**YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

You have the right to:

**Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

**Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

**Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

**Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:

▪ If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.

▪  Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.

▪  Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

▪ You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
