Company activity 
Activité de l’entreprise
SIG Energy Technology (SIG Innotech) is a French company founded in 2015 in Paris, specializing in lithium-ion battery cells and modules. The company focuses on developing and supplying high-performance battery solutions to support the integration of renewable energy and the expansion of electric mobility. By distributing lithium-ion cells and designing custom battery packs across Europe, SIG Innotech helps reduce environmental impact through cleaner energy storage and transportation solutions.
SIG Innotech collaborates closely with system integrators and project developers to deliver batteries tailored to specific needs. Every battery solution can include not only the cells and modules but also the Battery Management System (BMS), connectors, and protective components – all optimized for the best performance and safety. The company emphasizes eco-design in its hardware: modules are engineered for easy disassembly to simplify recycling, and they incorporate recycled materials (such as plastics from electronic waste) whenever possible. This commitment to sustainability ensures that each product is both high-quality and aligned with environmental standards.
Expertise and Capabilities
SIG Innotech’s expertise spans both hardware engineering and software development, enabling the company to provide comprehensive energy storage solutions. The team’s skills cover the full spectrum of battery system development – from initial design through testing and final integration. Key areas of expertise include:
Hardware Engineering & Battery Design
● Battery Cell & Module Design: The company’s engineering team (bureau d’étude) offers support at each stage of a battery project. They select high-quality, reliable lithium-ion cells and assemble them into modules that meet client specifications. Mechanical and electrical designs are optimized for performance, safety, and longevity. Each module is designed with modularity and serviceability in mind, which means batteries can be easily scaled and maintained.
● Custom Battery Packs: SIG Innotech develops complete battery packs, integrating cells into modules and modules into full battery systems. These packs are customized for the application at hand – whether it’s an electric vehicle, an industrial machine, or a stationary storage system. The hardware design includes robust enclosures, thermal management solutions, and all necessary connectors and interfaces.
● Battery Management Systems (BMS) Integration: Hardware expertise also extends to integrating BMS hardware. SIG Innotech proposes and incorporates BMS units suited to the application’s requirements (voltage, capacity, safety features, communication protocols, etc.). The company works with both off-the-shelf and custom BMS, ensuring that the battery packs are monitored and controlled effectively for optimal performance and safety.
Embedded Software & BMS Development
● Embedded Software: Alongside hardware, SIG Innotech provides embedded software expertise to guarantee that the battery’s electronic control systems function seamlessly. This includes firmware development for BMS and other microcontrollers within the battery pack. The embedded software manages critical functions such as cell balancing, state-of-charge calculations, fault detection, and communications with other systems (like a vehicle’s onboard computer or an energy management system in a building).
● System Integration: The company’s software engineers ensure that the BMS firmware is finely tuned to the specific battery chemistry and use-case. They implement algorithms for accurate State-of-Charge (SoC) and State-of-Health (SoH) estimation, which are essential for reliable operation. By mastering both the hardware and the software, SIG Innotech can optimize the interaction between the physical battery components and the digital control logic. This integrated approach results in battery systems that are efficient, safe, and intelligent, ready to communicate with broader systems (vehicles, charging infrastructure, smart grids) through standard protocols.
● Data Management & Monitoring: SIG Innotech also utilizes software tools for data logging and analysis. During both development and deployment, battery performance data is collected (e.g., charge/discharge rates, temperatures, voltages of individual cells). The company’s software processes this data to inform improvements and to provide clients with insights about their battery’s performance over time. Remote monitoring solutions can be implemented, enabling real-time tracking of battery status and predictive maintenance.
In-House Battery Testing Laboratory
One of SIG Innotech’s key strengths is its in-house battery cell testing capability. The company has established its own testing laboratory to rigorously evaluate cells and battery modules under various conditions. This internal lab ensures that only proven, reliable cells are used in client projects and that custom battery designs meet their specifications. The in-house testing services include:
● Internal Resistance Testing (DCR): Measuring the Direct Current Resistance of cells to assess their internal impedance. A low internal resistance is crucial for high power output and efficiency. SIG Innotech performs DCR tests to select cells that will deliver the necessary performance for high-current applications.
● Capacity Testing at Different C-Rates: Verifying cell capacity and behavior under various charge and discharge rates (C-rates). By testing cells at slow, moderate, and high discharge rates, the team can characterize how the capacity and voltage response hold up under stress. This helps in understanding the cell’s performance for both energy-intensive and power-intensive use cases.
● State-of-Charge vs. Open-Circuit Voltage (SOC-OCV) Characterization: Recording the cell’s voltage at different states of charge to establish an SOC-OCV curve. This data is important for accurate battery management system calibration, as it helps translate voltage readings into precise state-of-charge estimates.
● Cycling Tests (Lifecycle Testing): Performing repeated charge/discharge cycles (for example, continuous 1C charge and 1C discharge cycles) to evaluate how the cell’s capacity and performance degrade over time. Cycle life testing (such as 100% Depth of Discharge cycles) provides insight into the battery longevity and helps predict maintenance intervals or replacement timelines.
● Environmental and Safety Testing: Although not explicitly listed on the site, SIG Innotech’s laboratory is equipped to conduct a range of other tests on request. This may include thermal performance evaluations, safety tests under abuse conditions (overcharge, short-circuit, etc.), and verifying the effectiveness of battery protection features. All tests adhere to relevant standards to ensure the batteries meet industry safety and reliability criteria.
By conducting these tests in-house, SIG Innotech maintains high quality control over the components it supplies and designs. The laboratory’s findings guide the selection of cells and the design of battery packs, ensuring that each solution is validated and reliable before deployment.
